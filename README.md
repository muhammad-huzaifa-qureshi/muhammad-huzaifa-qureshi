# 👋 About Me

I am currently in my 6th semester of Software Engineering at Air University, with a strong focus on **backend development**, **scalable APIs**, and **robust software architectures**.

## 💻 Backend Development

I actively work with **Python** and **FastAPI** to build reliable, maintainable, and high-performance backend systems. My expertise includes:

- 🗄️ Designing and integrating **PostgreSQL** and **NoSQL databases**  
- 🔒 Implementing **authentication, authorization, and real-time features**  
- ☁️ Deploying production-ready applications on **cloud platforms like Google Cloud Run**  
- 🧹 Applying **clean code practices** and **modular architecture**  
- 🧪 Writing **unit, integration, and end-to-end tests** for robust systems  
- ⚡ Implementing **caching strategies, rate limiting, and async task handling** for performance and reliability  

## ✍️ Technical Communication

Alongside development, I enjoy **technical writing and explaining complex concepts**, strengthening both communication and understanding of software systems.

## 🎯 Goals & Collaboration

I am driven by continuous learning, building meaningful systems, and contributing to projects with real-world impact. Open to **backend development opportunities, collaborations, and knowledge-sharing discussions**.
